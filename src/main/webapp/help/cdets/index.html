<h3>2. Setting Overview</h3>
<p>
    Cdets [Trend] Widget setting consists of one or more "CDETS Advanced Query",
    each has three components:
    <ol>
        <li><i class="key-word">Display Name:</i> helps understand meanings of each number in Fig. 1</li>
        <li><i class="key-word">Advanced Query:</i> CDETS Defect Query, see Fig. 2 for details.</li>
        <li><i class="key-word">Details Url:</i> optional, if specified the display name will be clickable, linking to whatever you give.</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<div class="note">
    <h3>Notice, "Advanced Query" should contains Project & Product information</h3>
    We are not performing real time CDETS query using "Advanced Query"s you specified,
    because it's time-consuming and will burden CDETS heavily. Instead, we cache defects
    in CDETS, in a manner of lazy mode: only those needed will be cached. That is, we parse
    the query, extract product, and if it is not cached already, we will cache the product before
    displaying it. So it's important to give "Product" & "Project" components when filling "Advanced Query" field,
    at least for the first time.

<h3>3. Advanced Query Example</h3>
<pre>
    Expert search provides an advanced search method in CDETS where users can enter their own search string.

    The following operators are supported: =, >, >=, <, <=, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL, AND, OR, NOT, LIKE, (), <> and wildcards *, ?

    Tips
    The search syntax is different from SQL and that of QDDTS.
    Enclose field names in square brackets '[' ']'.
    Enclose field values in single quotes.

    Examples
    [Status] = 'R' or [Status] = 'V' and ( [Submitted-on] >= '01/31/2000 00:00:00' and [Submitted-on]<= '01/31/2001 00:00:00' )
    [Product] = 'cdets' and ( ( [Severity] = '1' or [Severity] = '2' ) or ( [Urgency] = 'P1' or [Urgency] = 'P2' ) )
